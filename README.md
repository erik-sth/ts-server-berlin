# Berlin Project

Distributing Students to Their Paths in a Timetable

## Introduction
During our school trip to Berlin, my teacher jokingly suggested creating a Berlin app to simplify the planning process. The idea evolved to include displaying each student's schedule on a website and a lot more usefull features.

## Algorithm History
1. In each approach, the initial step involved building a graph. Here's a brief overview:
2. DFS for Each Student: Applied a depth-first search for each student to optimize path exploration and assignment.
3. Priority Queue: Introduced a priority queue for students, giving preference to those with more individualized elements.
4. Find All Paths: Explored all paths and attempted to distribute students accordingly, followed by allocation based on these numbers.
5. Path Filtering: Enhanced efficiency by filtering out unnecessary data during the distribution process.
6. Maxflow Graphs: Attempted to use maxflow graphs to distribute students to each path, but this solution proved challenging.
7. Prioritizing Roommates: Augmented the algorithm by prioritizing roommates in the allocation proccess, when they made the same choices.
